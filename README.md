Text Adventure Game Development

In this assignment, I was tasked with designing a text-based adventure game by covering below mentioned Python essentials, but not limited to:
  1) Strings and String Manipulation
  2) User-Defined Functions and Variables
  3) User Input and Input Handling
  4) Conditional and Nested Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)
  5) Loops
  6) Controlling for Errors


This game takes a contestant through a jungle survival experience. The contestant has to face 3 levels of difficulties. No knowledge or skills are required. This game is purely based on luck. Have a look at the "Game Map" before beginning the game.

The three tragedy stages of the game are mentioned below:       
  1) Tragedy 1: EAT A FRUIT OR NOT
     Whether the fruit is poisonous or not depends on your luck.
     Contestant gets 2 attempts
     (Inspired from – “Snow White” story)
  
  2) Tragedy 2: ENCOUNTER WITH RANDOM WILD ANIMAL
     Whether the wild animal attacks you or not depends on your luck.
     Contestant gets 2 attempts only if there is an invalid entry
     (Inspired from – “The Two friends and the Bear” story)
  
  3) Tragedy 3: CROSS THE RIVER OR WAIT FOR FOREST OFFICIALS TO RESCUE
     Whether you win or lose depends on your luck.
     Contestant gets 2 attempts.
     (Inspired from – “Camp or walk in a plane crash” case)
